# Hotel_management


In Hotel management project, we will have the information of the items or rooms that we have, what food items are ordered by the customer, and how many rooms are allotted to them. Also, this project will tell us about the sales and the remaining food stock we have in the hotel, and the total collection for the day.
This project not only enhanced my proficiency in C++ programming but also demonstrated my ability to analyze complex requirements, design effective solutions, and collaborate with stakeholders to deliver a successful software application.
